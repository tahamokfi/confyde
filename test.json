      "briefSummary": "This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of selumetinib when given together with paclitaxel as a second line therapy in treating patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Selumetinib may stop or slow the growth of tumor cells by blocking a protein called mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) that is needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving selumetinib together with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of three pre-planned arms of continuous, intermittent, and pulsatile selumetinib with paclitaxel as second-line treatment in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the preliminary clinical response of continuous, intermittent, and pulsatile selumetinib with paclitaxel as second-line treatment in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nII. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with selumetinib/paclitaxel.\n\nII. To assess correlations between cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) molecular features from blood and molecular features and pathways from the biopsy samples, and use this as a surrogate measure of tumor response and duration of response as evaluated in the primary and secondary objectives.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study of selumetinib. The goal is to find out what dose and dosing schedule is the most effective in this population. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over a fixed rate on days 1 and 8.\n\nARM II: Patients receive selumetinib PO BID on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 and paclitaxel as in Arm I.\n\nARM III: Patients receive selumetinib PO BID on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and paclitaxel as in Arm I.\n\nIn all three arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing clinical benefit from study treatment may continue treatment based on the principal investigator (PI) approval on a patient-by-patient basis.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for 12 months, and then every 3 months thereafter."
